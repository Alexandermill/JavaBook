The "User Agent Switcher and Manager" extension allows you to alter your browser's User-Agent string, which is used by web servers to provide content to you. Based on your browser type and operating system, web servers may provide different HTML content (such as a different styling or lower resolution images) or the JavaScript engine may operate differently. By altering your browser's User-Agent string with this extension, you can get the content intended for a different device, such as mobile content instead of desktop content for faster and lighter web browsing.
