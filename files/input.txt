The "User Agent Switcher and Manager" extension allows you to alter your browser's User-Agent string, which is used by web servers to provide content to you. Based on your browser type and operating system, web servers may provide different HTML content (such as a different styling or lower resolution images) or the JavaScript engine may operate differently. By altering your browser's User-Agent string with this extension, you can get the content intended for a different device, such as mobile content instead of desktop content for faster and lighter web browsing.
As of version 0.2.4, you can define a user-agent string for the current window only. This means that all other browser windows will use the global setting except the current window. This may help you organize your work better. Note that you can have as many user-agent strings per-window as you want. To reset the window-based UA settings use the "Restart" button in the toolbar popup. This button basically restarts the extension and hence all the temporarily settings are wiped. So the window based settings is not a permanent setting (there is no way to find a window when a browser is restarted). It works until all the tabs in the window are closed or the extension gets reloaded. To differentiate the window with a defined user-agent string, this extension adds a badge notification to the toolbar area. For the users of black- and white-list modes, please read the options page to make sure how the black- and white-lists are affected by the newly introduced window-based user-agent string setting.
